 abstract = {The work sought to relate the bread with the market, analyzing the aspects of production and consumption, in order to see demand conditions, so it was necessary to perform statistical calculations for its preparation. Within the introduction, it is shown briefly which was made during the study. Whereas several tools were used to build the equation of the quantity demanded of bread, the theoretical concepts are explained such. And we present a methodology concisely all that was done during the study. These data obtained by regression calculations were then analyzed in order to understand the behavior of the demand, and thus get the economics in which bread can affect (directly or indirectly), shortly thereafter, were Simulations with respect to the consumption of breads considering percentage changes in the variables found at the end of the calculations, so to have a knowledge of the probable amount of demand for breads. At the end of the study, presents the final considerations about the procedures performed and the results obtained.},
