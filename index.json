Nevertheless, it already accounts for 17% of the National Interconnected Network. Due to the great intricacy of wind speed variations, it is difficult to predict wind energy with high accuracy. This research offers, in these circumstances, an ensemble learning model based on variational mode decomposition and singular spectrum analysis in decomposition in multiple stages, using stacking-ensemble learning. The proposed model is tested and applied in short-term wind speed data from a wind farm located in Parazinho in the northeast region of Brazil, using a multi-step-ahead forecasting strategy. The selected models for forecasting were the machine learning models partial least squares regression, -nearest neighbors, cubist regression, support vector regression, and ridge regression. The results of the study were divided into three comparative experiments: comparisons with (i) dual decomposed models, (ii) single decomposed models, and (iii) decomposed models. Concerning performance improvement, in the first experiment, the model was compared to dual decomposition models with an average performance between 3.71% and 21.38%. In the second experiment, mean performance improved between 37.18 and 52.47 percent compared to single decomposition. Lastly, the proposed model delivered, on average, 54.98% better results than the models without decomposition. In summary, all compared models in all forecasting horizons were surpassed by the proposed model, with an average improvement between 3.69 and 56.61 percent, showing that the dual decomposition ensemble learning model is an effective and accurate approach for forecasting wind speed.","tags":null,"title":"Multi-step short-term wind speed forecasting based on multi-stage decomposition coupled with stacking-ensemble learning approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M√°rcia de F√°tima Morais","Matheus Henrique Dal Molin Ribeiro","Ramon Gomes da Silva","Viviana Cocco Mariani","Leandro dos Santos Coelho"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"0032564fceb54bed8a20eb0750ba015f","permalink":"https://ramongss.github.io/publication/morais-discrete-2022/","publishdate":"2022-03-03T01:56:56.585917Z","relpermalink":"/publication/morais-discrete-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Scheduling problems (SP) in the permutation flow shop (PFS) environment are present in many intermittent production industries, consisting of to determinate the processing order of n jobs in m sequential machines, with the purpose to optimize some performance criterion.

Knowing the wind power generation within a specific time window is useful for facilitating decision making in terms of maintenance, electricity market clearing, and reload sharing. However, the effect of climatic and demographic factors on wind power generation sometimes makes time series forecasting a complex task. Thus, this study evaluates an ensemble learning model that combines bagging and stacking methods applied to time series forecasting with very short-term (10 and 30-minutes) and short-term (60 and 120-minutes) evaluations of wind power generation. Arithmetic and weighted average values were used to integrate the samples from bagging strategy. The weights are defined through multi-objective optimization using a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm ‚Äì version II, aiming to enhance the forecasting accuracy and stability simultaneously. To demonstrate the wide applicability of the non-linear ensemble learning model, it is extensively tested with measurement data collected from two wind farms in Bahia State, Brazil. The experimental results show that the proposed ensemble learning model achieves a better forecasting performance than single forecasting models, such as stacking, machine learning, artificial neural networks, and statistical models, with values of approximately 7.63%, 7.58%, 20.8%, and 25%, respectively, in terms of the errors for out-of-sample forecasting reduction. In addition, results with a weighted average are 87.5% superior to those with an arithmetic average for out-of-sample wind power forecasting in the evaluated forecasting horizons. The findings show that the integration of ensemble strategies can provide accurate forecasting results in the renewable energy field.","tags":null,"title":"Efficient bootstrap stacking ensemble learning model applied to wind power generation forecasting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matheus Henrique Dal Molin Ribeiro","Ramon Gomes da Silva","Jos√© Henrique Klein√ºbing Larcher","Viviana Cocco Mariani","Leandro Santos Coelho"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1635811200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635811200,"objectID":"3e73c56921eff126118afa519d5b0f67","permalink":"https://ramongss.github.io/publication/ribeiro-2021-springer/","publishdate":"2021-11-02T16:59:33.591674Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ribeiro-2021-springer/","section":"publication","summary":"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19), according to the World Health Organization, by September 4th, 2020, has infected more than 26 million people, and more than 865 thousand have died from it in the worldwide.

In this chapter, several artificial intelligence (AI) models including extreme gradient boosting, extreme learning machine, long short-term memory, and support vector regression are used stand-alone, and coupled with the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) employed to decompose the time-series into several intrinsic mode functions and residual signals. All AI techniques are evaluated in the task of forecasting daily incidence COVID-19 cases in ten Brazilian states, with a high number of cases by September 4th, 2020, with seven and fourteen-days-ahead. Previous COVID-19 incidence cases and urban mobility information were employed as systems input for all forecasting models. The models' effectiveness are  evaluated based on the performance criteria. In general, the EEMD approach outperformed the compared models regarding the accuracy in 65% of the cases. Regarding the exogenous variables, urban mobility information indeed plays a key role in the forecasting task.

Consequently, the development of efficient models is essentials to short and long-term forecasting, supporting health care officials to optimally disseminate available resources in the dengue-prone areas. Hybridization of two or more models is a common solution to this problem where one can take advantage of diversity among models to reduce both the bias and variances of the prediction error obtained using single models. Fortunately, the use of ensemble approaches becomes attractive. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble learning approach combining the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Coyote Optimization Algorithm (COA) to capture the nonlinearity in a dataset and perform dengue cases forecasting. The performance of the XGBoost model depends upon the appropriate choice of its hyperparameters. In this study, COA has been employed to tune the XGBoost hyperparameters. The proposed hybrid COA-XGBoost model is applied to predicting dengue time-series dataset from Parana, Brazil. Averages of precipitation, temperature, thermal amplitude, relative humidity, and previous dengue cases are considered as input variables as well as dengue cases are used as output variables. The performance of the proposed COA-XGBoost model has been compared with XGBoost when hyperparameters are obtained using other optimization techniques like Differential Evolution, Genetic Algorithm, Cuckoo Search Optimization, Grey Wolf Optimizer, and Firefly Algorithm. The results indicate that the proposed COA‚ÄìXGBoost can be competitive model when compared to other classical techniques.","tags":null,"title":"Dengue cases forecasting based on extreme gradient boosting ensemble with coyote optimization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jos√© Henrique Klein√ºbing Larcher","Ramon Gomes da Silva","Matheus Henrique Dal Molin Ribeiro","Leandro Santos Coelho","Viviana Cocco Mariani"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1625097600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625097600,"objectID":"fa64918796227a6ec8dd4fd4dd155749","permalink":"https://ramongss.github.io/publication/larcher-forecasting-2021/","publishdate":"2022-03-02T23:16:59.248686Z","relpermalink":"/publication/larcher-forecasting-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Forecasts can help in the decision-making process.
