The approached forecasting models were k-Nearest Neighbors, Partial Least Squares Regression, Ridge Regression, Support Vector Regression, and Cubist Regression. Additionally, Box-Cox transformation, correlation matrix, and principal component analysis were used to pre-process the data. The performance of the proposed forecasting models was evaluated by using three performance metrics: mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, and root mean square error, and the Diebold-Mariano statistical test to evaluate the forecasting error signals. The proposed models outperform the CEEMD, STACK, and single models in all forecasting horizons, with a performance improvement that ranges 0.06%‚Äì97.53%.

It is important to forecast the incidence of cases in a short-term horizon to help the public health system develop strategic planning to deal with the COVID-19. In this chapter, several artificial intelligence (AI) models including extreme gradient boosting, extreme learning machine, long short-term memory, and support vector regression are used stand-alone, and coupled with the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) employed to decompose the time-series into several intrinsic mode functions and residual signals. All AI techniques are evaluated in the task of forecasting daily incidence COVID-19 cases in ten Brazilian states, with a high number of cases by September 4th, 2020, with seven and fourteen-days-ahead. Previous COVID-19 incidence cases and urban mobility information were employed as systems input for all forecasting models. The models' effectiveness are  evaluated based on the performance criteria. In general, the EEMD approach outperformed the compared models regarding the accuracy in 65% of the cases. Regarding the exogenous variables, urban mobility information indeed plays a key role in the forecasting task. Therefore, due to the efficiency of evaluated forecasting models to forecasting cumulative COVID-19 cases up to fourteen-days-ahead, the adopted models can be recommended as promising models for forecasting and can be used to assist in development of public policies to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 outbreak.","tags":null,"title":"Ensemble learning models coupled with urban mobility information applied to predict COVID-19 incidence cases","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ramon Gomes da Silva","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Developing efficient short-term forecasting models allow knowing the number of future COVID-19 cases.

In this paper, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and machine learning approaches called cubist regression (CUBIST), k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), support vector regression (SVR), and stacked generalization (STACK) are evaluated in the task of time series forecasting six-days-ahead of the COVID-19 cumulative confirmed cases in four Brazilian  cities with high daily incidence. In the STACK approach, the kNN and SVR models are adopted as base-learners and CUBIST as meta-learner. The models' effectiveness is evaluated based on performance metrics including improvement index, mean absolute error, root mean squared error, and symmetric mean absolute percentage error. In most of the evaluated COVID-19 cases, the STACK reached a better performance regarding adopted criteria when compared with other models. In general, the developed models can generate accurate forecasting, achieving errors in a range of 0.28% - 1.62% in six-days-ahead. The ranking of the models in most scenarios is STACK, ARIMA, SVR, and kNN. The use of evaluated models is recommended to forecast and monitor the ongoing growth of COVID-19 cases, once these models can assist the managers in the decision-making support systems.","tags":null,"title":"Forecasting the cumulative cases of COVID-19 in four large Brazilian cities using machine learning approaches","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matheus Henrique Dal Molin Ribeiro","Ramon Gomes da Silva","Jos√© Henrique Klein√ºbing Larcher","Viviana Cocco Mariani","Leandro Santos Coelho"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1606780800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606780800,"objectID":"d1523105ebfc227d7751c181bf4ff5d7","permalink":"https://ramongss.github.io/publication/ribeiro-2020-insidmagazine/","publishdate":"2021-03-29T17:07:27.198342Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ribeiro-2020-insidmagazine/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Intelig√™ncia artificial como suporte a tomada de decis√£o para previs√£o de novos casos do coronav√≠rus (COVID-19)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matheus Henrique Dal Molin Ribeiro","Ramon Gomes da Silva","Viviana Cocco Mariani","Leandro Santos Coelho"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1604188800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604188800,"objectID":"3d3ddea308ec9b6aa9e78125f28cd57c","permalink":"https://ramongss.github.io/publication/ribeiro-2020-encit/","publishdate":"2020-11-01T14:51:30.103444Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ribeiro-2020-encit/","section":"publication","summary":"The objective of this paper is to develop an efficient ensemble learning model to predict the heating load (HL)and the cooling load (CL) of residential buildings, considering eight input variables (relative compactness, surface area,wall area, roof area, overall height, orientation, glazing area, and glazing area distribution).

Therefore, due to the efficiency of evaluated models to forecasting cumulative COVID-19 cases up to six-days-ahead, the adopted models can be recommended as a promising models for forecasting and be used to assist in the development of public policies to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 outbreak.","tags":["Artificial intelligence","COVID-19","Exogenous variables","Forecasting","Variational mode decomposition","Machine learning"],"title":"Forecasting Brazilian and American COVID-19 cases based on artificial intelligence coupled with climatic exogenous variables","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matheus Henrique Dal Molin Ribeiro","Ramon Gomes da Silva","Cristiane Canton","Naylene Fraccanabbia","Viviana Cocco Mariani","Leandro Santos Coelho"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1595116800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1595116800,"objectID":"71f1a1d57f1ec5e4ee4a5c3c2da7f384","permalink":"https://ramongss.github.io/publication/ribeiro-2020-electricity/","publishdate":"2020-09-29T14:51:30.109429Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ribeiro-2020-electricity/","section":"publication","summary":"The development of accurate models to forecast electricity energy prices is a challenge due to the number of factors which can affect this commodity. In this paper, a hybrid multi-stage approach is proposed to forecast multi-stepahead (one, two and three-month-ahead) Brazilian commercial and residential electricity energy prices. The proposed data analysis combines the pre-processing named complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) in the first stage coupled with the coyote optimization algorithm (COA) to define the CEEMD‚Äôs hyperparameters, aiming to deal with time series non-linearities and enhance the model‚Äôs performance. On the next stage, four machine learning models named extreme learning machine, Gaussian process, gradient boosting machine, and relevance vector machine are employed to train and predict the CEEMD‚Äôs components. Finally, in the final stage, the results of the previous step are directly integrated to compose a heterogeneous ensemble learning of components to obtain the final forecasts. In this case, a grid of models is obtained. The best model is one that has better generalization out-of-sample. Through developed comparisons, results showed that combining COA-CEEMD with a heterogeneous ensemble learning can develop accurate forecasts.

The objective of this paper is to develop a novel decomposition-ensemble learning model that combines Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) and Stacking-ensemble learning (STACK) with machine learning algorithms to forecast the Bitcoin price multi-step ahead. The algorithms are k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Regression with Linear kernel, Feed-forward Artificial Neural Network with single-layer perceptron, Generalized Linear Model, and Cubist.

Due to the high level of uncertainty of the factors that directly interfere in the generation of solar power, such as temperature and solar radiation, make predictions of solar power with high precision is a challenge. Thus, the objective of this article is to develop a forecasting model, through time series, that makes it possible to predict the production of power energy, using a database collected in a photovoltaic plant in Uruguay.

In order to overcome this issue, a preprocessing step is desirable to provide more reliable data. Decomposition strategy is reported as the crucial component of this improving task of the wind speed forecasting. It can be applied as the first step or as a recurrent process, and normally the raw wind speed data is decomposed in several signal patterns. Based on this understanding, this paper proposed a combination of two signal decomposition strategies, known as variational mode decomposition (VMD) and singular spectral analysis (SSA), with modulation signal theory. The proposed decomposition approach is further coupled with a long short-term memory neural network (LSTM), the adaptive neuro-fuzzy system (ANFIS), echo state network (ESN), support vector regression (SVR) and Gaussian regression process (GRP) models resulting in new ensemble learning approaches. All results obtained through these ensembles are compared between them and demonstrated an error stabilization behavior, ability decomposing the wind speed into uncorrelated components, reducing the errors from one up to twelve steps-ahead forecasting. In general terms, the results indicate that ensembles learning framework are robust and reliable to applications in wind speed forecasting task.","tags":null,"title":"Multi-step wind speed forecasting based on hybrid multi-stage decomposition model and long short-term memory neural network","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matheus Henrique Dal Molin Ribeiro","Ramon Gomes da Silva","Viviana Cocco Mariani","Leandro dos Santos Coelho"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1590969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590969600,"objectID":"0bf85b00fdeb468a71d906b7647814eb","permalink":"https://ramongss.github.io/publication/ribeiro-2020-short/","publishdate":"2020-05-13T02:27:14.578051Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ribeiro-2020-short/","section":"publication","summary":"The new Coronavirus (COVID-19) is an emerging disease responsible for infecting millions of people since the first notification until nowadays.
