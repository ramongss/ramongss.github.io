# `> Hello, World!` :wave:

I am **Ramon G. da Silva**, Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science :mortar_board: and currently working as Research Professor at [Industrial and Systems Engineering Graduate Program (PPGEPS) at PUCPR](https://www.pucpr.br/escola-politecnica/industrial-and-systems/).

My research focuses on leveraging machine learning and AI techniques for time series forecasting :chart_with_upwards_trend:. I've applied these methods across diverse domains -- including [wind energy production in Brazilian wind farms](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142061522005051), [COVID-19 cases predictions in Brazil and U.S. (with meteorological data)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960077920304252), and [cryptocurrecy (Bitcoin) price trends](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9207152).

I code in both [**R** (#rstats)](https://www.r-project.org/) and [**Python**](https://www.python.org/). and when I’m not working with data, I’m probably playing guitar :guitar: -- you can even find a few rock singles I recorded on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5H5Ht9iimWk5MVXMQV3Ta9?si=yriOrXVKScSGYsjDfVdEUw) (check it out). Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramongomesdasilva/) :envelope: or any of my social accounts. And yes, I'm still recovering from the last Star Wars trilogy :sweat_smile:.
