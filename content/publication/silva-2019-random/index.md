abstract: "This random scenarios were generated by applying a normal distribution for processing time of machine 1 (p1). From p2 to pn (processing time of machine n), it was made a random variation up to more or less 20, 50 and 70% from the processing time of the previous machine. Further, the number of machines can be 5, 10 or 15."
