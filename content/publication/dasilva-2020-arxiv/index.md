abstract: "Accurate forecasting is important for decision-makers. Recently, the Amazon rainforest is reaching record levels of the number of fires, a situation that concerns both climate and public health problems. Obtaining the desired forecasting accuracy becomes difficult and challenging. In this paper were developed a novel heterogeneous decomposition-ensemble model by using Seasonal and Trend decomposition based on Loess in combination with algorithms for short-term load forecasting multi-month-ahead, to explore temporal patterns of Amazon rainforest fires in Brazil. The results demonstrate the proposed decomposition-ensemble models can provide more accurate forecasting evaluated by performance measures. Diebold-Mariano statistical test showed the proposed models are better than other compared models, but it is statistically equal to one of them."
