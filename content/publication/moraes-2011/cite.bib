 abstract = {This article aims at the construction and analysis of some indicators, showing the ratings on the economic dynamics of the productive structure of the municipalities of Baixo Amazonas and Marajó and this may identify the cities that have dynamic activities on these regions contributing to the discussion of regions in state of Pará. For this case, we used some indicators presented by Santana (2004) as location quotient (LQ), the concentration index of Herfindahl-Hirschman (IHH) and the Participation Relative index (PR), for each one employing all the formal activities in the state and having as variable the number of formal jobs in the city of each activity in the period to be analyzed in: 2000, 2005 and 2010. These three indices can be folded and classify that activity as to its dynamism in the productive structure.},
